# Enhanced Skill Matching Test Results

## Improvements Made

### 1. **Comprehensive Skill Synonyms Database**
- Added 100+ skill synonyms and variations
- Covers programming languages, frameworks, tools, and technologies
- Examples:
  - `javascript` → `['js', 'ecmascript', 'es6', 'es2015', 'es2020', 'vanilla js']`
  - `react` → `['reactjs', 'react.js', 'react js', 'react native']`
  - `node.js` → `['nodejs', 'node', 'node js']`

### 2. **Advanced Pattern Matching**
- **Word Boundary Matching**: Uses regex `\b` for exact matches
- **Phrase Matching**: Finds skills in different contexts
- **Partial Matching**: Handles variations like `reactjs` for `react`
- **Fuzzy Matching**: Catches common misspellings

### 3. **Section-Aware Scoring**
- **Skills Section**: 100% weight (highest priority)
- **Projects Section**: 80% weight (practical application)
- **Experience Section**: 70% weight (work experience)
- **Certifications**: 60% weight (formal recognition)
- **Education**: 40% weight (academic background)
- **General**: 30% weight (casual mention)

### 4. **Confidence-Based Ranking**
- Each skill match gets a confidence score (0-1)
- Higher confidence matches are prioritized
- Final scores are weighted by confidence levels
